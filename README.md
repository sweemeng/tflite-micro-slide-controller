# TFlite micro slide controller demo

This is a demo modified from the Gesture to emoji demo on arduino. https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoTensorFlowLiteTutorials/tree/master/GestureToEmoji

The modification here is code change needed to run on platformio. Another different also a different gesture, thus the `model.h` file is different and training is also slightly different to accomodate different gesture(swipe_right, swipe_left and swipe_down). 

Gesture training colab is here. I hope to turn the notebook into app later.
